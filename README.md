# Physics Engine Prototype

A very very very very primitive ~~physics engine~~ 3D scene that nearly resembles a prototype of an physics engine I developed for fun.

Goals: 
- [x] import of .obj (wavefront) files
- [x] camera movement
- [ ] orthographic and perspective projection
- [x] object movement
- [x] collision detection through AABB
- [ ] collision handling
