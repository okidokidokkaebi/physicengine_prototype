# Physics Engine Prototype

A very very very very primitive ~~physics engine~~ 3D scene that nearly resembles a prototype of an physics engine I developed for fun.

Goals: 
- ~~import of .obj (wavefront) files~~
- ~~camera movement~~
- orthographic and perspective projection
- ~~object movement~~
- ~~collision detection through AABB~~
- collision handling
